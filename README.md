# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Project Setup

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Build the project for production:
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

4. Preview the production build:
    ```sh
    npm run preview
    ```

## Project Description

This project demonstrates a simple React application with a counter and a dynamic header. The application consists of the following components:

- `App.jsx`: The main component that renders the counter and header components.
- `HeaderButton.jsx`: A component that allows the user to change the header title.
- `Header.jsx`: A component that displays the header title.

The project uses Vite for fast development and build processes.
